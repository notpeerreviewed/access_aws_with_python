## Data Warehouse project - Data Engineering Nano Degree

### Files and order of execution

This project includes the requisite python scripts as included in the template, plus an additional script to generate the Redshift cluster beforehand and a script to allow easy deletion of the Redshift cluster after use.

There is an additional script that includes several test queries to examine the data loaded into the tables.

The files should be executed in the following order:

- create_redshift.py
- create_tables.py
- etl.py
- delete_redshift.py
